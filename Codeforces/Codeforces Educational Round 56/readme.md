**Problem A** was the simplest codeforces problem I have done in a long time. Since there were multiple possible answers and I could output any of them, it was as easy as just printing out the input divided by 2 (using integer division) for each test case.

**Problem B** could be solved by taking in the input string as an array of characters and sorting it. The sorted array was placed into a StringBuilder and then was checked to see if the sorted string was a palindrome. If it returned true, the program would return -1. If false, the sorted String was considered **good** and the program would return the sorted String.
