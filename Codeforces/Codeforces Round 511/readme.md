* __Problem A \- Little C Loves 3 I__ \- The input for this problem was a single integer _n_\. The problem output consisted of 3 intgers whose sum was _n_, but none of which were multiples of 3\. 
I solved this problem using an if\-else approach\. If _n_ itself was divisible by 3, but not divisible by 9, I output all 3 integers equal to _n_/3\. If _n_%3 was equal to 2, I output the numbers 1, 2, and _n_\-3\.
If _n_%3 was equal to 1, I output the numbers 1, 1, and _n_\-2\.
* __Problem B \- Cover Points__ \- Given _n_ pairs of Integers representing \(_x_, _y_\) points on a coordinate plane, the problem required me to output the minimum side length of a 45\-45\-90 triangle with the shorter sides lying on the _xy_\-axes\.
To solve this problem one needed to find the maximum sum of the two numbers in a pair.
