Problem A - I solved this problem by first comparing the lengths of the two strings. If they were different lengths, I printed out "No." If they were the same lengths, I checked each index of both strings, making sure that they had vowels at the same indexes and consonants at the same indexes. If I looped through without returning false, I would print "Yes." I would print "No" otherwise.
